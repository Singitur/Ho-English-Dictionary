The word bacteria is the plural of the Neo-Latin bacterium, which is the Latinisation of the Ancient Greek βακτήριον (baktḗrion), the diminutive of βακτηρία (baktēría), meaning “staff, cane”, because the first ones to be discovered were rod-shaped.

Eugenics (/juːˈdʒɛnɪks/ yoo-JEN-iks; from Ancient Greek εύ̃ (eû) 'good, well' and -γενής (genḗs) 'come into being, growing') is a set of beliefs and practices that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human population.

The eugenics movement became associated with Nazi Germany and the Holocaust when the defense of many of the defendants at the Nuremberg trials of 1945 to 1946 attempted to justify their human-rights abuses by claiming there was little difference between the Nazi eugenics programs and the US eugenics programs.	1945 aete 1946 reaḱ Nuremberg trial kore, sapangi defendant koaḱ defense ko do, Nazi koaḱ Eugenics program re anḍoḱ US aḱ Eugenics program re beteḱ ge sapaniṅ menaḱ mente argue keet́ akoaḱ human rights abuse ko justify ê teaḱkô attempt let́ te, Eugenics movement do Nazi Germany oḍoḱ Holocaust loḱ associate eana.

By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.	13th century re nen sultanate iate, dao ge dao Mongol raider ko darom kôl ean te, India save eana West anḍoḱ Central Asia re hoba ean devastation aete, nena ko te ge tayom en Region aete nir tan soldier, scholar, mystic, trader, artist, artisan ko chiminaṅ century subcontinent te ko migrate hućoḱ teaḱ hora bai eana, enate ge north re syncretic Indo-Islamic culture bai eana.

The East India Company's control of the seas, greater resources, and more advanced military training and technology led it to increasingly assert its military strength and caused it to become attractive to a portion of the Indian elite; these factors were crucial in allowing the company to gain control over the Bengal region by 1765 and sideline the other European companies.

Man has many wishes that he does not really wish to fulfil, and it would be a misunderstanding to suppose the contrary. He wants them to remain wishes, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfilment would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is the desire for eternal life. If it were fulfilled, man would become thoroughly sick of living eternally, and yearn for death.
